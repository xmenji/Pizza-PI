# Pizza-PI
Programming Challenge from "Starting out with C++" Chapter 3

Joe's Pizza Palace needs a program to calculate the number of slices of pizza of any size
can be divided into. The program should perform the following steps:
A) Ask the user for the diameter of the pizza in inches
B) Calculate the number of slices that may be taken from a pizza of that size
C) Display a message telling the number of slices

To calculate the number of slices that may be taken from the pizza, you must know the following
facts:

-Each slice should have an area of 14.125 inches
-To calculate the number of slices, simply divide the area of the pizza by 14.125
-The area of the pizza is calculated with this formula:
	Area = pi*r^2
